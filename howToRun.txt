I don't have an exe yall, you'll have to do sm manual.
in terminal, in hakathon2024, run
firstVirtualPrototype\Scripts\activate
cd modelScripts


from here, the short way:
python main.py

alternatively, the long way:
python runLlama.py    //this gives you a file from the vmeows folder , that the llama ai picked out just for you 
python run_cmd.py     //this runs it <3
(My pet lamma helpes you find some vulnerabilities in your system. )
(This is the order of script running. Beware the scripts in vimeows, you don't wanna be running those. (wink) (they'll be run anyways, wink2) )
